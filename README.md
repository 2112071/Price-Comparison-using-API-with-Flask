                                                              **Price Comparison using API with Flask**

## Project Overview
This project is designed to help users compare the prices of products from various e-commerce platforms by fetching real-time data through APIs. The web application is built using Flask, providing an intuitive interface for users to search for products and see price comparisons. It enables users to make more informed purchasing decisions by presenting price differences across multiple online stores.

## Features
- **Product Search**: Allows users to search for products by entering a product name or category.
- **API Integration**: Connects to different e-commerce platforms via their APIs to retrieve product prices.
- **Price Comparison**: Displays a clear and concise comparison of product prices across multiple websites.
- **User Interface**: The web interface is simple and responsive, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Manages invalid searches and API errors gracefully, providing feedback when no results are found.

## Technology Stack
- Backend: The backend of the application is powered by Flask, a Python micro-framework for building web applications.
- Frontend: The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
- APIs: The application interacts with various e-commerce platforms' APIs, such as Amazon, eBay, and Flipkart, to gather pricing data.
- Database: An optional SQLite database can be used for storing user preferences, search history, or favorite products.

## Installation Instructions
The application requires Python and Flask, along with other necessary libraries, which can be installed by referencing the project's dependency list.

## Usage
Users can enter the product name or category they want to search for, and the application will fetch prices from different platforms. The app then displays the price comparison, and users can choose the platform they prefer for purchasing.

## API Configuration
To integrate with various e-commerce platforms, you will need API keys from those platforms (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Flipkart). Once you have the keys, they can be added to the project configuration file.
